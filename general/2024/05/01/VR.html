<h1><a id="virtual-reality-to-treat-seasonal-affective-disorder" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Virtual Reality to treat Seasonal affective Disorder</h1>
<p>Every winter I experience seasonal affective disorder. Around novemeber, as the trees become bare and the days become darker, I feel an increase in anxiety and low mood. I feel similar to how the enviroment appears around me - everything looks to be lifeless, dull, and bleak. And I also begin experiencing symptoms - headaches, aches, cognitive decline, and low mood.</p>
<p>As someone who's gone through this year after year after year, I can tell you that it's really difficult.</p>
<p>Naturally I try to adapt. Many years I'll start antidepressant medications around november. I also try to adapt my diet. I start using light therapy. I closely monitor my habits. I try to make sure that I'm checking off all the boxes. But even after all these changes, I often end up short of feeling well.</p>
<p>All of this has led me to think about the nature of the condition.</p>
<p>Seasonal Affective disorder is commonly attributed to changes in light. Light influences key biological processes that affect mood and mental health such as our circadian rhythms, serotonin, and melatonin production. Light therapy, using boxes that replicate natural light, is a common and often effective treatment.</p>
<p>However, light is only one of the visual inputs that change as the seasons change. It's likely that other visual inputs besides light play a role - these include the visual changes in enviroment, scenery, and color : the enviroment becomes less green and more grey and dull; The trees looked barren and bleak; The sky is dark, etc.</p>
<p>Suggesting that other visual cues may play a role isn't a radical idea. It's widely accepted that a person's living enviroment and their surroundings can impact their mental health. So If an individual is sensitive to enviromental changes, it's possible this could result a depressive episode.</p>
<p>Research supports the idea that a variety of visual cues impact mental health. For instance, there's research that shows that color can affect mood and behaivor. Exposure to the color red, for example, can measurably impact performance on cognitive tasks. Similarly, exposure to natural and green environments has been proven to help people feel calm. This suggests that SAD could be influenced by more than just reduced light exposure, and that multiple factors might be involved, which light therapy alone cannot address.</p>
<p>However, the conversation for treatment options for SAD usually centers on the idea of using light therapy. Light therapy has the most research backing its effectiveness. And for a long time, this was one of the only options to treat the disorder.</p>
<p>But I think we need to evaluate and consider new options.</p>
<p>Virtual Reality treatment has the potential to treat SAD in ways that light therapy alone cannot. This is because VR can mimic the conditions, scenery, colors of enviroments that may provide relief for individuals experiencing SAD - it's possible people experiencing SAD just need a a small time of relief from their difficult enviroment, an alternative perspective to get a small glimpse of before returning to the barren world.</p>
<p>Virtual reality has already been explored as a tool to treat anxiety disorders and phobias by exposing patients to uncomfortable situations in a controlled manner. Given its success in these areas and its relatively recent emergence, it's possible that VR's potential as a treatment for SAD has not yet been fully researched and exploited.</p>
<p>I have started exploring VR applications that might help treat SAD, available on platforms like Meta Quest. There are  a few apps designed for meditation and nature trek, but the environments in these apps can sometimes appear somewhat artificial. I'm not sure if they would help but we'll see.</p>
