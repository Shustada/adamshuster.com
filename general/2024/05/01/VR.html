<h1><a id="virtual-reality-to-treat-seasonal-affective-disorder" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Virtual Reality to treat Seasonal affective Disorder</h1>
<p>Every winter, I experience seasonal affective disorder. Around November, as the trees become bare and the days grow darker, I feel anxious and my mood dips. I begin to feel similar to how the landscape looks—lifeless, dull, and bleak—and I suffer symptoms like headaches, aches, cognitive decline, and low mood.</p>
<p>As someone who has gone through this year after year, I can tell you that it's a difficult and frustrating experience.</p>
<p>Naturally, I try to adapt. I start taking antidepressant medications around November, adjust my diet, begin using light therapy, and closely monitor my habits to ensure I'm checking off all the boxes. But even after all these changes, I often fall short of feeling well.</p>
<p>This has led me to think about the nature of the condition.</p>
<p>This condition is commonly attributed to changes in light. Light influences key biological processes that affect mood and mental health such as our circadian rhythms, serotonin, and melatonin production. Light therapy, using boxes that replicate natural light, is a often an effective treatment.</p>
<p>However, light is just one of the many visual inputs that change as the seasons change. There are likely other visual inputs besides light that impact how we feel—these include the visual changes in environment, scenery, and color.</p>
<p>The idea that seasonal changes in scenery, color, and environment can influence seasonal depression isn't radical. It's widely accepted that a person's living environment and their surroundings can impact their mental health. So, it's possible that seasonal depression results from a person being sensitive to their environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Research supports the idea that a variety of visual cues impact mental health. For instance, color can affect mood and behavior. Exposure to the color red, for example, has been shown to measurably impact performance on cognitive tasks. Similarly, exposure to natural and green environments has been shown to help people feel calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>This suggests that SAD could be influenced by more than just reduced light exposure, and that multiple factors might be involved, which light therapy alone cannot address.</p>
<p>However, the conversation about treatment options for SAD usually centers on light therapy, which has the most research backing its effectiveness. But what if there are other ways to treat this condition?</p>
<p>One of my theories is that virtual reality (VR) could help treat seasonal depression. This area hasn't been well-researched to my knowledge, perhaps because VR was, for a long time, price-prohibitive for regular consumers.</p>
<p>Now that VR is affordable for everyday consumers, it's possible the technology could play an important role in treating the condition.</p>
<p>Virtual Reality treatment has the potential to treat SAD in ways that light therapy alone cannot. This is because VR can mimic the conditions, scenery, and colors of environments that may provide relief for individuals experiencing SAD—it's possible people just need a short time of relief from their challenging environment, an alternative perspective to glimpse before returning to the barren world.</p>
<p>Virtual reality has already been explored as a tool to treat anxiety disorders and phobias by exposing patients to uncomfortable situations in a controlled manner. Given its success in these areas and its relatively recent emergence, it's possible that VR's potential as a treatment for SAD has not yet been fully researched and exploited.</p>
<p>I have started exploring VR applications that might help treat SAD, available on platforms like Meta Quest. There are a few apps designed for meditation and nature treks, but the environments in these apps can sometimes appear somewhat artificial. I'm not sure if they would help, but we'll see.</p>
