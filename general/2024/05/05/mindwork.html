<h2><a id="reflections-on-mindfullness-and-work" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflections on Mindfullness and Work</h2>
<p>Jon Kabat-Zinn describes mindfulness as the simple act of paying attention on purpose. this is a good definiton and the one i use to think about mindfulness.</p>
<p>But I also like to think of mindfullness in terms of an analogy. Mindfulness is like a light switch. The on-mode is when you're in a mindful state. The off-mode is the mindless state. But there's a caveat.<br />
<img src="light.jpeg" alt="light" /><br />
This is not a normal switch. the switch takes a purposeful effort to turn on to enter the on-mode.</p>
<p>And unlike most switches, the switch often doesn't feel comfortable in the on-mode. What do I mean by this ?</p>
<p>When the switch is in the on-mode, many times, the switch feels a tension pulling it back down to turn off and enter the mindless state.</p>
<p>So in short, this switch takes purposeful effort to turn on. There's a tension on the switch that often tries to slowly turn the switch off. And often times, it's difficult to notice when the switch is turned off.</p>
<p>If you want to concentrate on a task for a long period of time, it's important to keep the light in on-mode for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Many times, the light will switch off, and when it does that's okay, but it's important to notice that its off and then try to turn it back on.</p>
<p>For some people, it's easy to keep the light in on-mode.</p>
<p>But for others, the light will frequently turn on and off. On. Off. On. Off. On. Off.</p>
<p>This can be a frustrating scenario. If a person isn't skilled in noticing when the light is off and purposely turning it  back on, then they won't be able to spend much time in on-mode. And if they aren't able to spend time in on-mode, then they won't be able to concentrate for long periods of time or complete things.</p>
<p>I'm one of those people. Sometimes I have trouble keeping the light in on-mode. Sometimes the light turns off frequently and I have to turn it back on over and over. On. Off. On. Off.</p>
<p>For me, it's easier to keep the light in on-mode  if I'm really having fun with the task that I'm doing. Sometimes this means having music in the background. sometimes this means simply reflecting about what I enjoy about what I'm working on and why the work is meaningful to me.</p>
<p>If I'm not having fun, the light will turn off quicker with less effort and more frequently.</p>
<p>After prolonged concentration, I notice that I can feel tension building in my body, and I might lose awareness, slipping into a mindless state. There are usually physical signs that I may or may not notice: my leg starts bouncing, I feel restless, and I have the urge to move. When I realize that my focus has lapsed, I try to take a deep breath and become aware of my body, and consciously re-engaging helps me refocus.</p>
<p>For me, having fun with work is crucial to keeping the light on. If I can find enjoy in what I'm doing, then it's easier for me to concentrate and keep the light on.</p>
<p>These are really simple concepts but sometimes I believe they can be overlooked or under utilized. Sometimes these concepts are not taught to students. I think with rise of smart phones people lose control over their attention. But attention and learning how to engage with it and control it is crucial for personal and self development.</p>
