<h2><a id="reflections-on-mindfulness-and-work" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mindfulness and Work</h2>
<p>Recently, I've been reflecting about the topic of mindfulness and its relationship to work. Naturally, many of us do. It's common for people to explore these topics and seek to develop habits that enhance our mental health and overall lives.</p>
<p>But the concept and practice of mindfulness can seem a bit abstract at times - a realization that many naturally end up at. What exactly is it ? How can I apply it ? From these questions, people develop their own mental models to make sense of it and understand.</p>
<p>I'll share mine. the reason I am writing this down is because sometimes I feel the need to let my thoughts out - to describe the mental models I use to understand the world.</p>
<p>There a few different ways that I think about mindfulness.</p>
<p>Jon Kabat-Zinn, a widekly known professor and a mindfulness expert, describes mindfulness as paying attention on purpose in the present moment non judgmentally. This means to be in the present moment, and to be aware of our thoughts, feelings, and surroundings, but choosing not to judge or label our thoughts or feelings as good or bad, just accepting what is.</p>
<p>It's a good definition. But I also like to think of mindfullness in terms of an analogy.</p>
<p><img src="light.jpeg" alt="light" />￼</p>
<p>I think of mindfulness as a light switch. The on-mode is a state of mindfulness, being present, full concentration on task at hand. The off-mode is the mind's preference to wander, to switch tasks, to be distracted and outside the present moment.</p>
<p>But there's a caveat. This switch likes to turn off on its own. The light switch slowly likes to revert and turn back off, as if a rubber band is pulling it back down. But it can be difficlt to tell when it turns off - we're not aware of the exact moment we lose concentration and focus but when we become aware, we have the opportunity to turn it back on.</p>
<p>For some people, it's easy to stay in on-mode. But for others, the light turns off frequently.</p>
<p>I'm one of those people. Sometimes the light turns off and I have trouble noticing its off. Sometimes I have to put a lot of effort to turn it back on.</p>
<p>If I'm concentrating or working on something for a long period of time, I can sense mindesssness in my body - there are usually physical signs that I may or may not notice: my leg starts bouncing, I feel restless, and or I feel the urge to move or do something different. Frequent task-switching is often associated with the inability to concentrate.</p>
<h2><a id="having-fun-is-important" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>having fun is important</h2>
<p>I've come to learn that if I'm really enjoying the work and having fun with the task, it's easier to stay focused and keep the light on. Sometimes this means having music in the background. sometimes this means simply reflecting about what I enjoy about what I'm working on and why the work is meaningful to me.</p>
<p>This is an idea I've gained appreciation for over time : having fun within work and learning is really important. When we approach work and learning with the intention of enjoyment and having fun, it makes the work easier to do and it's easier to concentrate and motivated.</p>
<p>This might seem like a simple insight, but it's a powerful one. Recently I've been listening to the podcast 'How I built this' which features many entrepreneurs and builders. A trend I noticed is that business people who are interviewed generally really enjoy what they're doing. They do what they do because they love the work and they often speak about finding fun in overcoming obstacles, whether those are business problems, social issues, or the process of building a strong company.</p>
<p>That's a good way to approach challenges—by having fun with them. Enjoyment and fun not only deepen our focus and concentration but also enhance our work and learning. They help us stay engaged and attentive.</p>
<h2><a id="mindfulness-and-employment" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mindfulness and Jobs.</h2>
<p>Many jobs involve performing repetitive tasks quickly, which can make mindfulness challenging. If you have experience with such work, you know how easy it is for the mind to shift into an automatic, mindless mode to efficiently handle these tasks.</p>
<p>This mode not only helps pass the time but also allows workers to 'check out' - essentially detaching from the present moment. Staying mindful under these conditions can be difficult as the mind often prefers to switch off to cope with the monotony. But there are usually ways to check back in and its usually helpful to do so.</p>
<p>In general, one of the best ways to improve mindfulness is to slow down. Slowing down makes it easier to pay attention to the present moment and the tasks at hand. And the great thing about the workforce is that many times workers have the ability to control the speed at which they work - for the most part.</p>
<p>In my job, I make an effort to be particularly mindful during tasks where I typically 'check out.' In the mornings, I concentrate on staying present and relaxed as I work.</p>
