<h2><a id="reflections-on-mindfulness-and-work" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflections on Mindfulness and Work</h2>
<p>Jon Kabat-Zinn describes mindfulness as the simple act of paying attention on purpose. this is a good definiton and the one i use to think about mindfulness.</p>
<p>But I also like to think of mindfullness in terms of an analogy. Mindfulness is like a light switch. The on-mode is when you're in a mindful state. The off-mode is the mindless state. But there's a caveat.<br />
<img src="light.jpeg" alt="light" /><br />
This is not a normal switch. the switch takes a purposeful effort to turn on to enter the on-mode. And when the switch is turned on, many times, the switch feels a tension, a rubber band essentially, pulling it back down to turn off and enter the mindless state.</p>
<p>With a normal switch, it takes little to any effort effort to turn on. But with this switch, it takes effort to turn on. With a normal switch, the light can stay on indefinitely (until your power runs out). But with this switch, the switch doesn't feel comfortable staying in on-mode and slowly tries to turn itself back off.</p>
<p>So in short, this switch takes purposeful effort to turn on. There's a tension on the switch that often tries to slowly turn the switch off. And it can be difficult to notice when the switch is turned off.</p>
<p>If you want to concentrate on a task for a long period of time, it's important to keep the light in on-mode for as long as possible.</p>
<p>For some people, it's easy to keep the light in on-mode.</p>
<p>But for others, the light will frequently turn on and off. On. Off. On. Off. On. Off.</p>
<p>This can be a frustrating scenario. If a person isn't skilled in noticing when the light is off and purposely turning it  back on, then they won't be able to spend much time in on-mode. And if they aren't able to spend time in on-mode, then they won't be able to concentrate for long periods of time or complete things.</p>
<p>I'm one of those people. Sometimes I have trouble keeping the light in on-mode. Sometimes the light turns off frequently and I have to put effort to turn it back on over and over. On. Off. On. Off.</p>
<p>For me, it's easier to keep the light in on-mode if I'm really having fun with the task that I'm doing. Sometimes this means having music in the background. sometimes this means simply reflecting about what I enjoy about what I'm working on and why the work is meaningful to me.</p>
<p>If I'm not having fun with the task or enjoying the task, the light switch will turn off quicker with less effort and more frequently.</p>
<p>If I'm concentrating or working on something for a long period of time, there are usually physical signs that I may or may not notice: my leg starts bouncing, I feel restless, and or I feel the urge to move or do something different. Frequent task-switching is often associated with the inability to concentrate.</p>
<p>For me, having fun with work and trying to enjoy what I'm working on is crucial for me to keep the light on. If I can find enjoy in what I'm doing, then it's easier for me to concentrate and the light doesn't turn off as frequently.</p>
<p>These are really simple concepts on attention and mindfulness presented with my own unique analogy.  Although these concepts are simple, sometimes they can be overlooked or under utilized, and I believe presenting these concepts with simple analogies can help deepend understanding and help us utilize them more effectly.</p>
<p>I believe it's also important to emphasize enjoyment and having fun. It's important to have fun with learning. It's important to have fun with work. Enjoyment and fun helps to deepen our focus and concentration and improve our work and learning.</p>
<p>But I think this often isn't emphasized in our work and learning enviroments.</p>
