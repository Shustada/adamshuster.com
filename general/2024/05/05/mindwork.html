<h2><a id="reflections-on-mindfulness-and-work" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflections on Mindfulness and Work</h2>
<p>Recently, I've been thinking about mindfulness and it's relationship to work. like many people, I've struggled with mindfulness at times. At various points throughout my life, I have found it difficult to really apply and leverage its principles. For me, leveraging mindfulness principles involves constant practice and really trying to understand what it is.</p>
<p>Jon Kabat-Zinn describes mindfulness as paying attention on purpose in the present moment non judgmentally. This means to be in the present moment, and to be aware of our thoughts, feelings, and surroundings, but choosing not to judge or label our thoughts or feelings as good or bad, just accepting what is. at least that is how I interpret it.</p>
<p>I think this is a good definition, but I also like to think of mindfullness in terms of an analogy.</p>
<p><img src="light.jpeg" alt="light" />￼</p>
<p>I like to think of mindfulness as a light switch. The on-mode is a state of mindfulness, being present, full concentration on task at hand. The off-mode is the mind's preference to wander, to switch tasks, to be distracted and outside the present moment. But there's a caveat. With this light switch, it's difficult to stay in on-mode, a mode of mindfulness and concentration, for a long period of time. the mind often times like to revert back to a mindless state. The light switch slowly likes to turn back off, as if a rubber band is pulling it back down to turn off. And it's sometimes difficult to be aware that the light is off.</p>
<p>For some people, it's easy to keep the light in on-mode. But for others, the light will frequently turn off and they have to put a lot of effort to turn it back on. I'm one of those people. Sometimes I have trouble keeping the light in on-mode. Sometimes the light turns off frequently and I have to put effort to turn it back on over and over.</p>
<p>If I'm concentrating or working on something for a long period of time, there are usually physical signs that I may or may not notice: my leg starts bouncing, I feel restless, and or I feel the urge to move or do something different. Frequent task-switching is often associated with the inability to concentrate.</p>
<p>But it's easier for me to keep the light in on-mode if I'm really having fun with the task that I'm doing. Sometimes this means having music in the background. sometimes this means simply reflecting about what I enjoy about what I'm working on and why the work is meaningful to me.</p>
<p>This is an idea I've gained appreciation for over time : having fun within work and learning is really important. When we approach work and learning with the intention of enjoyment and having fun, it makes the work easier to do and it's easier to concentrate and motivated.</p>
<p>This might seem like a simple insight, but it's a powerful one. Recently I've been listening to the podcast 'How I built this' which features many entrepreneurs and builders. A trend I noticed is that business people who are interviewed generally really enjoy what they're doing. They do what they do because they love the work and they often speak about finding fun in overcoming obstacles, whether those are business problems, social issues, or the process of building a strong company.</p>
<p>That's a good way to approach challenges—by having fun with them. Enjoyment and fun not only deepen our focus and concentration but also enhance our work and learning. They help us stay engaged and attentive.</p>
