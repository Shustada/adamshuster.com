<h2><a id="reflections-on-mindfulness-and-work" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflections on Mindfulness and Work</h2>
<p>Jon Kabat-Zinn describes mindfulness as the simple act of paying attention on purpose. this is a good definiton and the one i use to think about mindfulness.</p>
<p>But I also like to think of mindfullness in terms of an analogy. For me, Mindfulness is like a light switch. The on-mode is when I'm in a mindful state. The off-mode is the mindless state. But there's a caveat.<br />
<img src="light.jpeg" alt="light" /><br />
This is not a normal switch. the switch takes a purposeful effort to turn on to enter the on-mode. And when the switch is turned on, many times, the switch feels a tension, a rubber band essentially, pulling it back down to turn off and enter the mindless state.</p>
<p>With a regular household switch, it takes little effort to turn the light on and you can keep the light on in-definitely.</p>
<p>But with the unique switch in my analogy, the switch takes effort to turn on and it doesn't feel comfortable staying in on-mode. Every time it's turned on, It slowly feels the pressure to turn off again - there's a tension, a rubber band, pulling the switch down to turn off -- to mindlessness steady state.</p>
<p>So in short, this switch takes purposeful effort to turn on. There's a tension on the switch that often tries to slowly turn the switch off. And it can be difficult to notice when the switch is turned off.</p>
<p>If one wants to concentrate on a task for a long period of time, it's important to keep the light in on-mode for as long as possible.</p>
<p>For some people, it's easy to keep the light in on-mode.</p>
<p>But for others, the light will frequently turn on and off.</p>
<p>*On. Off. On. Off. On. Off. *</p>
<p>This can be a frustrating scenario. If a person isn't skilled in noticing when the light is off and purposely turning it  back on, then they won't be able to spend much time in on-mode. And if they aren't able to spend time in on-mode, then they won't be able to concentrate for long periods of time or complete things.</p>
<p>I'm one of those people. Sometimes I have trouble keeping the light in on-mode. Sometimes the light turns off frequently and I have to put effort to turn it back on over and over.</p>
<p>*On. Off. On. Off. On. Off. *</p>
<p>If I'm concentrating or working on something for a long period of time, there are usually physical signs that I may or may not notice: my leg starts bouncing, I feel restless, and or I feel the urge to move or do something different. Frequent task-switching is often associated with the inability to concentrate.</p>
<p>For me, it's easier to keep the light in on-mode if I'm really having fun with the task that I'm doing. Sometimes this means having music in the background. sometimes this means simply reflecting about what I enjoy about what I'm working on and why the work is meaningful to me.</p>
<p>If I'm not having fun with the task or enjoying the task, the light switch will turn off quicker with less effort and more frequently.</p>
<p>These are really simple concepts on attention and mindfulness presented with my own unique analogy.  Although these concepts are simple, sometimes they can be overlooked or under utilized, and I believe presenting these concepts with simple analogies can help deepend understanding and help us utilize them more effectly.</p>
<p>Enjoying your work and having fun with it is crucial for producing good results. This might seem like a simple insight, but it's a powerful one. Many successful business leaders, as I've listened from numerous podcasts, emphasize this point. CEOs and founders often pursue their work because they find it enjoyable, not merely for financial gains. For instance, a 70-year-old serial entrepreneur launching another venture is likely motivated by the joy and significance of the challenge, not the financial reward. They often speak about finding fun in overcoming obstacles, whether those are business problems, social issues, or the process of building a strong company.</p>
<p>That's a good way to approach challenges - have fun with them.  Enjoyment and fun helps to deepen our focus and concentration and improve our work and learning. It helps us to stay focused. But I think this idea often isn't emphasized in our work and learning enviroments. Sometimes we want to turn away from challenges rather torward them</p>
<p>As an additional note, I'd mention that this analogy resonates with my understanding of mindfulness, although it may not be as effective for everyone, given that each person's experiences are unique. The switch analogy aligns closely with meditation practices. In meditation, the objective is to recognize when the mind drifts and to guide it back to the breathâ€”essentially noticing when the 'light' of focus dims and redirecting attention to restore it. The critical aspect is the continuous practice of observing and redirecting one's attention.</p>
