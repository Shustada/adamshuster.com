<h1><a id="baltimore-s-tranist-based-cataylst" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>#Baltimore's Tranist-Based Cataylst</h1>
<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about rail transit in Baltimore. Like many, I’m an advocate for rail and I believe Baltimore and the state of Maryland should prioritize rail investment to grow the state's economy. Rail development can be a catalyst project that simultaneously addresses issues in housing, crime, community health, and employment - multiple areas that all need attention in Baltimore and the state.</p>
<p>Ideally, Baltimore would  have a more comprehensive and extensive rail transit network, but there have been many challenges and roadblocks to reaching this desired outcome.  These challenges include the challenges financing, construction, implementation, and development of transit systems.</p>
<p>As the state works to overcome these challenges, I think it’s important to emphasize how transformative rail infrastructure development can be and how Rail Transit can act as catalyst projects that impacts our communties in multidimensional ways.</p>
<p>Maryland residents who advocate for rail are aware that rail transit systems can truly transform communties for the better. Throughout the world, what many thriving cities have in common is that they have a well-utilized rail system. This is because cities are essentially complex systems and that connect, house, transport, and employ people. Transit is the foundational component of the system and without successful transit the system doesn't operate effectively.</p>
<h2><a id="an-example-of-how-rail-can-catalyze-growth" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An example of how rail can catalyze growth</h2>
<p>Imagine it’s 2040. Over the past two decades, Maryland and Baltimore have pursued ambitious rail transit projects. Baltimore has completed the red line, connecting west Baltimore to jobs and other parts of the city. The Red Line has a dedicated right-of-way, significantly reducing commute times along its route.</p>
<p>Because of the Red Line, homes throughout West Baltimore now have better access to jobs and amenties, leading to increased desirability. Property values of these homes increase. Densely packed row homes, previously limited by parking and space, are now more attractive due to their proximity to reliable public transportation.</p>
<p>Baltimore’s row-home layout and narrow-street based grid has been reshaped and transformed by better access to public transit. Neighborhoods throughout the city have become more livable, attractive, and healthy. Residents no longer stress over car ownership or parking space, and they have easier commutes to work and school, fostering stronger community connections and better economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Crime rates drop as neigborhoods improve and property values increase. Residents feel a renewed sense of pride and investment in their communities. Infrastructure and housing projects gain momentum, revitalizing once-neglected areas. Access to better jobs steers individuals away from criminal activities.</p>
<p>Improved public transportation fosters integration across the city. People from diverse backgrounds and neighborhoods interact more frequently, creating a more connected and culturally rich environment. Trains pass through and intersect communinties carrying people who are normally segregrated from one another.</p>
<p>Abandoned boarded-up row homes find new occupants. Housing prices decrease, making Baltimore a more accessible place to live for all residents. As a result, families are now able to afford homes in the city.</p>
<p>Employers take note of these positive changes, finding Baltimore a more attractive location due to its robust public transportation and thriving community. The city begins to grow and expand its tax base, bringing in more revenue for the state.</p>
<p>As a result of the success and economic growth, the state continues to expand its network of rail systems, further integrating the city and compounding the effects.</p>
<p>This is a somewhat exaggerated illustration of how transit can act as a catalyst project. But it does showcase how transit can address many issues simultaneously and these outcomes are not out of the realm of possibility</p>
<h2><a id="transit-projects-complement-existing-assets-infrastructure-and-city-features" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Transit projects complement existing assets, infrastructure, and city features.</h2>
<p>The system of Baltimore needs to improve. It needs to overcome the challenges that have faced the city for decades. The city needs to become more livable. There are many areas that are simply not livable and do not provide high standards of living. To Make the city more livable to a broader range of residents, the city needs to tinker with the system in a way that complements existing features, assets, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The system of Baltimore needs to better connect residents to jobs and transport people throughout the city. The Central Maryland Transportation Alliance wrote a report that showed that only around 8.5% of the region’s jobs are accessible by public transportation within 1 hour. The Transit Center Foundation wrote a report showcasing how the Red Line could dramatically improve resident’s access to jobs.</p>
<p>It's my strong conviction that public transit would complement baltimore's existing assets and make the city a better place to work and live, and that public transit should be a top priority for the state.</p>
