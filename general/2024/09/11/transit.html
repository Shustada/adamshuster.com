<p>The State of Maryland must develop tools to effectively save for future transportation projects. Surprisingly, Maryland currently lacks a designated mechanism to set aside funds each year specifically for transit initiatives. The <strong>Maryland Transportation Trust Fund (TTF)</strong>—the main source for financing transportation projects—generally operates on a year-to-year basis, with revenues closely matching expenditures, leaving no surplus for future infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>To address this, Maryland could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a <strong>Transportation Reserve Fund</strong> within the existing <strong>TTF</strong>, ensuring that a portion of annual revenues is saved for future projects.</li>
<li>Create a Maryland Infrastructure Bank, following the lead of other states that have successfully used this model to finance infrastructure through loans and returns on investments.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the state could implement a combination of both solutions. However, setting up a Transportation Reserve Fund would be the simplest and most immediate action Maryland could take.</li>
</ul>
<p>The governor in Maryland holds significant power over the state budget and could and should propose a Transportation Reserve Fund in the annual budget submitted to the Maryland General Assembly. In addition, the governor could investigate the potential benefits of creating a state infrastructure bank to support long-term transportation financing.</p>
<p>Large-scale rail and infrastructure projects are financed through a variety of methods. Many states use Transportation Trust Funds that collect revenue from sources like fuel taxes, vehicle fees, and tolls to fund current projects and save for future ones. States also finance projects through federal grants, issuing bonds, borrowing, developing public-private partnerships (P3s), and contributions from local governments. Some states even establish separate infrastructure banks.</p>
<p>Maryland, like many other states, has a Transportation Trust Fund (TTF). However, there are several challenges with the TTF. First, it does not generate enough revenue to fund the large-scale projects Maryland will need in the future. Second, the TTF lacks a designated Transportation Reserve Fund to save for future projects. Currently, the TTF is used primarily to fund ongoing expenses. Additionally, one of the TTF’s main revenue sources, the motor fuel tax, is expected to decline over the next decade as more residents switch to electric vehicles.</p>
<p><u><strong>Breakdown of TTF Revenues (FY 2023):</strong></u><br />

<p>A benefit of establishing a Transportation Reserve Fund within the TTF is that it would allow Maryland to save more effectively for future projects. The reserve fund could invest surpluses in low-risk financial products, such as treasury securities, state bonds, or CDs. These investments would compound over time, helping the state responsibly save for future transportation projects. The state can Earmark these funds for specific purposes like rail transit - this would be a safety measure from administrations to ensure funds are directed as they were meant to  such as the Hogan Administration.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Let’s say Maryland had started in 2000 by investing just 1% of TTF revenues—around $50 million per year—into a Transportation Reserve Fund, with a 3% annual return (common with low-risk options like treasury securities). Over 24 years, this fund would have grown to approximately $1.74 billion. If the state had invested 2% of TTF revenues, or about $100 million per year, the fund could have grown to around $3.44 billion.</p>
<p>The problem isn't just that the TTF lacks a reserve fund; it's also that TTF revenue is projected to decline. By 2031, electric vehicles are expected to account for around 26% of Maryland’s vehicles, leading to a significant drop in fuel tax revenues.</p>
<p>One way to address this shortfall is to start directing a portion of General Fund contributions to the TTF and a newly established reserve fund. Currently, the TTF is funded solely by transit-related revenue sources as shown in the tables above, but these sources are not enough to meet future needs and are expected to decline. A straightforward solution would be to redirect a small portion of General Fund revenues each year to the TTF or directly into a Transportation Reserve Fund.</p>
<p>The second option Maryland could consider is setting up a State Infrastructure Bank for transportation projects. Infrastructure banks have advantages and disadvantages compared to reserve funds. Many states have established infrastructure banks, which operate as self-sustaining entities. These banks typically receive an initial capital infusion but do not require ongoing expenses. They can provide loans for rail projects, create revolving funds for future projects, and work in partnership with federal funding and public-private partnerships (P3s). While setting up an infrastructure bank is more complex, it could offer significant long-term benefits.</p>
<p>At the core of this argument is that Maryland should be saving and investing money specifically earmarked for future rail projects. Why? High-quality rail infrastructure directly benefits the state’s budget by driving economic growth, which boosts personal income and property tax revenue. States with robust transportation systems attract businesses and workers with higher incomes, generating even more revenue for the state. Additionally, investing in transportation infrastructure is symbolic, much like investing in education—it shows that Maryland is serious about building a better future for the next generation.</p>
<p>Maryland must choose a strategy. Given the importance of transit projects for future generations, state revenue, and economic growth, the state must either create a transportation reserve fund within the TTF earmarked for future projects or establish a state infrastructure bank. The opportunity cost of inaction is simply too great.</p>
<p>It's important to note that these are direct actions that the the Governor-Moore administration can make - the governor's has a lot of power in maryland to create and shape the budget.</p>
