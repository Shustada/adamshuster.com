<h1><a id="reflections-on-work" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflections on Work</h1>
<p>If someone asked you, &quot;How would you define work?&quot; how would you respond? Do you ever reflect on the nature of work? It seems these are important questions. After all, many of us spend much of our lives working or engaging in work, and at times it can feel as though we're being pulled along by the conventions of work rather than defining work on our own terms.</p>
<p>There are many different definitions of work for different contexts. But if I were to define work, I’d simply describe it as the efforts required to create and provide valued goods and services.</p>
<p>One of the things I'd highlight in this definition is the concept of value.  Value is important in relation to work. At times workers forget this relationship and the concept of value is abstracted away from work. But at its core, income is essentially a price point reflecting how much a firm, society, or government values a person’s work over time.</p>
<p>When a firm hires someone, it determines that the value the worker provides within a set period, such as a year, is equal to or greater than the compensation they receive. This often is based on how much revenue the worker brings in or how much the firm believes the work is worth based on an assortement of metrics. The firm must measure this value and decide if the pay justifies the work.</p>
<p>Simply put, Employers hire workers to provide value to their firm. This concept may seem obvious but it often isn't neccessarily explicitly stated or reflected upon. There are some jobs where the assigned tasks are straightforward and there is no ambiguity to the work. But there are other positions where workers have to search for value. Workers are sometimes given abstract job tasks and responsibilties. In this sort of enviroment, it's up to the worker to discern what's valuable and what isn't.</p>
<p>In general, reflecting on value is a good starting point or good excercise for any worker for a variety of reasons. If a worker is looking to make an impact within an organization or they want to priortize productivity, it's essential that they identity the most valuable actions they can take.</p>
<p>Value can also align with what worker finds personally find meaningful, even if it doesn't directly contribute to particular organization goals or metrics. I find this idea comforting - that we all have the freedom to pursue what we value in the context of our work, as long as it doesn’t conflict with our primary duties. These efforts, while sometimes small, can still complement a person's overall work.</p>
<h2><a id="mindfulness-and-work" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mindfulness and Work</h2>
<p>I believe cultivating mindfulness is essential for people to do their best work. Why? Each day presents new opportunities to provide value and apply our skills, knowledge, and talents to the best of our abilities. The work we do in each moment is important, and to do good work in each moment, it's crucial to be fully present.</p>
<p>There are many ways to cultivate mindfulness, though it can sometimes be challenging. One of my favorite techniques is adopting a “beginner’s mind,” a concept practiced by Jon Kabat-Zinn. He illustrates this concept with a simple example: imagine you're an alien visiting Earth for the first time, and you’re given a raisin to eat. Since you've never eaten a raisin before, you approach the experience with intense curiosity, exploring every sensation as if it were entirely new. In reality, every moment we encounter is new and unique, and it’s important to recognize this.</p>
<p>However, work can often feel incredibly repetitive. We show up at the same office or workspace and perform the same tasks day after day. It’s easy to fall into automatic thinking in which we stop appreciating the uniqueness of each moment and lose our sense of curiosity. Over time, this automatic mode can be harmful to our mental health. Workers need to engage with each day, explore its uniqueness, and rediscover a sense of wonder in their environment. If we don't value each day in this way, we risk losing a sense of purpose and meaning in our lives.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the pace of modern work. Many jobs, especially in working-class environments, demand speed and efficiency, often at the expense of mindfulness. In fast-paced jobs—such as warehouse work, where productivity is relentlessly tracked—workers are often pushed to work faster, relying on automatic thinking to keep up. For some, this may be manageable, but for others, it can take a toll on their mental health. Over time, they may lose the ability to appreciate each day’s uniqueness, which can lead to a loss of meaning in their lives.</p>
<p>It’s important to develop strategies for cultivating mindfulness at work, especially in fast-paced environments. One effective method is taking “micro-breaks”—short pauses to reconnect with your breath. Another is using small transitions or routine tasks as opportunities to refocus. You can also practice mindful breathing while working, paying attention to your breath as you complete each task. Or, as I mentioned earlier, use the ‘beginner's mind’ technique with your work. Many workers are allowed to wear earbuds, and sometimes it's easier to mindfully focus on the music you're listening to rather than the repetitive tasks. In fact, this is what many workers do, and it’s beneficial.</p>
